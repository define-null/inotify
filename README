Introduction
------------
Inotify is on erlang port for the Linux inotify API allowing one to monitor
changes to files and directory in the filesystem.

Installation
------------
git clone https://github.com/define-null/inotify.git
cd inotify
make

Using inotify example:
-------------

Erl console:
> Mask = all.
> Callback = self().
> inotify_server:add_watch("/tmp/somefile", Mask, Callback).
{ok,<0.73.0>}

Bash: 
touch /tmp/somefile

Erl console:
> flush().
Shell got {<0.83.0>,{inotify_event,"/tmp/mu2",[open],0,[]}}
Shell got {<0.83.0>,{inotify_event,"/tmp/mu2",[attrib],0,[]}}
Shell got {<0.83.0>,{inotify_event,"/tmp/mu2",[close_write],0,[]}}

Also add_watch_link/3 is availuable, to link with handler process.

Mask is the one from http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man7/inotify.7.html
Callback could be a pid(), function(pid(), inotify_event()) and {Mod, Fun}.

In short, you can do anything you want with the code including using it as part
of you plan for world domination (if your successful can I have one of the nicer
countries please). No responsiblity it taken for the fitness of the any purpose,
etc, etc. The only thing I ask is that if you find a bug and fix send me the
patch. Likewise, feature suggestions and patches are welcome.

TODO
----
* Write more documentation!
